# Calculating Pi
This repository contains PHP source codes for the Ï€ (Pi) calculation that has been mentioned with the precision of 201 digits on my web page http://petrfaltus.net/petr-faltus-ludolfovo-cislo-vypocet-pi-na-201-desetinnych-mist.php (czech language only).

The original version of the PHP in May 2012 was 5.2.10 (cli). The current version now in February 2020 after transferring to this repository is 7.3.10 (cli). The used PHP needs the BCMath module for calculations.
